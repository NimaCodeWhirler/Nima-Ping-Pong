Low level coder looking to improve!

In this code I created a Ping Pong game with few bugs and little gameplay errors, 

The first problem that I faced is the uncontrollable speed of the ball that sometimes for no reason increase and decrease

The second problem is to create an invisible wall to block the two paddles to go out from the screen but I think I can fix it

I'm super open to criticism since it is my first code and I would love to get some tips, you can be harsh but be helpfull!
